### Project Overview

This project was my first substantial React project and a final part of my React course on Udemy. This food order app was a great exersize for me to use all the skills I learned in the basics of React fundamentals. 

From creating components, containers, managing state, utilizing react hooks, context, modals, and fetching data to form validation, dynamically rendering JSX and conditionally rendering classes.

### Takeaways

I took a lot away from this project, and I walked away with a lot of confidence knowing I had the fundamentals down and could code my way through the logic needed in future components.

### Technolgies Used

* HTML5 (JSX)
* CSS3 (classes)
* JavaScript (React)
